<p> 解决方法：</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>方法一：检查你运行 composer 的php版本是否是 7.4 版本。用 php 7.2 版本试试！！</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff9900;"><strong>方法二：如果是用7.4版本，就按标准的写法：</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p># 先更新源地址</p>
<p>/www/server/php/74/bin/php composer.phar config repo.packagist composer https://mirrors.aliyun.com/composer/</p>
<p># 标准写法</p>
<p>/www/server/php/74/bin/php composer.phar install</p>
<p>--- or ----</p>
<p>/www/server/php/74/bin/php -d disable_functions=''  composer.phar require php-di/php-di -W</p>
