# programming_blog_search_system

This is the result of my two-week study of Python crawler, Django framework and html programming in programming training, a course offered by the computer department in the summer semester of 2022. 
The content of this project is to read and download blog posts from a well-known Chinese programming learning blog, and then build a program learning website with its own search engine locally using Django framework. 
On this site, you can retrieve different blog posts according to keywords and blog-related programming languages, read the contents, understand the author and the relationship between blog posts, and refresh to get random blog posts. Even comment on the blog with a different user name! 
In this project, I improved my python skills and gained the skills of website writing.

!: The most important part is the "Final_Project". All my ideas, the design of the system, is all in that folder.
